# Source wavelet estimation
The autocorrelation of seismic signals can provide some preliminary information about the source. 

The code SOURCE_WAVELET_ESTIMATION.m was written to auto-correlate two files of seismic data in Segy format. The source wavelet is estimated based on the autocorrelation, and its amplitude and phase spectra can be found in the folder.
